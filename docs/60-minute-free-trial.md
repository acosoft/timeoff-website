# 60-Minute Free Trial

## What to Expect?

We want your TimeOFF workflow free trial to be simple and as close as possible to the real production experience. Here is what you get when you register for the free trial:

- Your own server for 60 minutes on **\<random>.barufa.com** domain
- Everything is preconfigured, including email delivery to your address
- An experience nearly identical to the production environment


## Why This Registration Process?

We use cal.com to schedule your trial so you always get a dedicated, reliable environment. This way, your experience is smooth and consistent every time. The process may not be the most seamless, but it guarantees fairness and stability for all users.

When you book a slot, you are reserving access to your own trial environment, not scheduling a meeting with sales representative. The entire process is automated so you can explore and test independently, at your chosen time.


## Who Should Register?

This is not a demo for n8n, nor will you receive access to the underlying n8n workflow. Instead, the trial is designed to demonstrate how the workflow helps employees and their managers speed up the process of handling leave requests. If you want to experience how TimeOFF can streamline and automate leave management in a real-world scenario, this trial is for you.


## How Does It Work?

1. After booking your slot, you will immediately receive a confirmation email from cal.com

2. Just before your trial starts, you will get a second email with a link to your trial environment.

   <img src="/img/trial/ready.png" alt="TimeOFF Free Trial" style={{maxWidth: "100%", borderRadius: "8px", marginBottom: '20px' }} />

All emails generated during the trial will be sent to the email address you used to reserve your time slot. When the trial ends, your environment and all data you entered during testing will be automatically deleted.

## In Short

Book your slot and get a confirmation. When your time comes, you will receive a link to start testing. Everything is ready for you. There are no extra steps or complications. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please contact us.
