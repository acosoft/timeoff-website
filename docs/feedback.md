This project is an experiment and a showcase. It also serves as a starting point for future LinkedIn articles. If you have an idea, a suggestion, or want to share your thoughts, you are welcome to get in touch. Contact me via my LinkedIn profile or open a ticket on GitHub.

For now, this is just for fun, but it could become something more serious in the future. Anything is possible.

If you are a developer and want to learn more about how this project was built and technologies I used, you can find more information on the [about page](/about).
